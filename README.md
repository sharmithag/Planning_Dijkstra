# Planning_Dijkstra
This project is done in the course ENPM 661.
Run Dijkstra-planning-Sharmitha-Ganesan.py  

Enter the start and the goal nodes  

The total number of nodes, the number of nodes in the obstacle space and the number of nodes that can be traversed are displayed. 

Approximately, the code takes 350 - 400 seconds to run.  

A canvas of the obstacle space including the clearance, a pygame amimation of traversing goal node, covered nodes in the workspace
and backtracked path in the workspace are displayed.


TESTCASES : (Check the videos provided)
